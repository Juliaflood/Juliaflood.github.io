        <h2> Water Lilies: By Julia Flood</h2>
        
        <p>The painter feels peaceful and serene as he paints the lilies that lay afloat the still body of water</p>
        <p> The lilies slowly move and float</p>
        <p>The painter feels a sense of completion as he dips his brush into the paint and moves it across the canvas</p>
        <p>The piece comes together and is able to become a masterpiece</p>
        <p>The lilies delicate petals move ever so slighly in the cool summer breeze</p>
        <p>Animals move in the woods besides the pond </p>
        <p>People walk across the green bridge above the lilies with colorful umbrellas</p>
        <p>Life moves aroudd the water lilies but the water lilies stay afloat peacfully spinning</p>
        <p> The coi fish move under the lilies sometimes flipping them over</p>
        <p> The artist is able to capture the beauty of these water lilies and the stillnes of them in the ponds of southern france </p>
